# Austing Animal Center

I obtained the data from Kaggle: [AAC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes?select=aac_intakes_outcomes.csv)

To have a look at the data I started by using MatPlotLib and SeaBorn to get some visualization.

-> [AAC_bargraph](Bar Chart AAC.ipynb)
I created a bar graph to show the condition of the animal during the intake, per number of animals.

Then a graph to see the outcome types of the animals per number of animals.
