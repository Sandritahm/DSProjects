# Data Science Projects

All the projects are just for fun and to practice my acquired skills. I am open to suggestions and comments.

## [Spot the differences](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/b3711e0cd6ef523251fc68a3a2c2e46cf2b73366/ComputerVisionProject/Readme.md)

A simple vision computer project that help find the differences between two pictures.

## [Nobel Laureated EDA](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/3831da7d0fdba760a7757161e7efd5d6c53200b3/Nobel%20Project/EDANobelLaureates.md)

The project used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravarora1091/nobel-laureates-from-1901-to-2022) and aimed to perform an EDA to get insights about the number of Laureates per Country and Field.

## [Austing Animal Center](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/5619b1ce0402540b65bc5f589c83cc57777ec517/AustingAnimalCenter/AustingAnimalCenter.md)

Using the AAC database, I tried to show the actual conditions of the center by visualizing the data. Also, I tested some algorithms such as Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict if an animal will be adopted or not.

## [House Prices](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/41f26a95c1d0d4ac7196c004a00132adfca38595/HousePriceProject/House_Price.md)

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and I did preprocess the data and developed a Neural Network to predict the price of houses. I got an accuracy of 87%.
