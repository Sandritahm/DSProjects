# Data Science Projects

All the projects are just for fun and to practice my acquired skills. I am open to suggestions and comments.

## [Austing Animal Center](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/5619b1ce0402540b65bc5f589c83cc57777ec517/AustingAnimalCenter/AustingAnimalCenter.md)

Using the AAC database, I tried to show the actual conditions of the center by visualizing the data. Also, I tested some algorithms such as Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict if an animal will be adopted or not.

## [House Prices](https://github.com/Sandritahm/DSProjects/blob/41f26a95c1d0d4ac7196c004a00132adfca38595/HousePriceProject/House_Price.md)

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and I did preprocess the data and developed a Neural Network to predict the price of houses. I got an accuracy of 87%.
