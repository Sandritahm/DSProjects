## Austing Animal Center

I obtained the data from Kaggle: [AAC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes?select=aac_intakes_outcomes.csv)

This is a project to practice my skills, so if you have any comments, I'm open to receiving them.

For analysis I used:

- Visualizations with Matplotlib
- [Decision Tree](AAC_Decision_tree.md)
- [Random Forest](AAC_random_forest.md)
- Neural Networks
